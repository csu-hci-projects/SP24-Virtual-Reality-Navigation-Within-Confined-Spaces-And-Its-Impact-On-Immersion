# SP24-Virtual-Reality-Navigation-Within-Confined-Spaces-And-Its-Impact-On-Immersion
This project was developed by us for CS 464 - Principles of Human-Computer Interaction in Spring 2024.

Redirected walking is a common technique used by VR developers in order to efficiently utilize the minimal space expected of each user
without breaking immersion. Differing methods of traversal within the VR plane, such as teleportation or joysticks, have also been used
to address the issue of limited space. Proper utilization of these techniques will allow users to experience much more than their physical
environments would normally allow. It is important to understand how these different techniques compare when it comes to efficiency and
important user experience metrics such as experienced user frustration, immersion, and VR motion sickness.

# Our Approaches
### Redirected Walking:
* For redirected walking, we utilized teleportation as a tool to implement the overlapping spaces technique which allow the user to move from one space to another while reusing the same physical location. Despite not having enough physical space to walk the distance, users were able to fully explore every area of the scene.   

### Joystick:
* By not physically moving and instead using a controller, participants were able to traverse freely with no physical limitations.

### Teleportation:
* By allowing the participant to freely teleport, as long as there is no objects in the way, participants will be able to traverse the scene freely without needing to traverse any confined spaces.
