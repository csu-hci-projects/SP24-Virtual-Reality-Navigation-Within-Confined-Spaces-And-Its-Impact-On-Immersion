# SP24-Virtual-Reality-Navigation-Within-Confined-Spaces-And-Its-Impact-On-Immersion
This project was developed by us for CS 464 - Principles of Human-Computer Interaction in Spring 2024.

Redirected walking is a common technique used by VR developers in order to efficiently utilize the minimal space expected of each user
without breaking immersion. Differing methods of traversal within the VR plane, such as arm swinging or joysticks, have also been used to
address the issue of limited space. Proper utilization of these techniques will allow users to experience much more than their physical
environments would normally allow. It is important to understand how these different techniques compare when it comes to efficiency and
important user experience metrics such as experienced user frustration, immersion, and VR motion sickness.

# Our Approaches
### Redirected Walking:
Impossible Spaces
* For redirected walking impossible spaces refers to distorting or manipulating space to create the illusion of an expansive environment in a small area.  

Overlapping Spaces
* For redirected walking overlapping spaces refers to taking multiple different environments or sections and reusing the same physical space.

### Method of Locomotion:
Joystick
* By not physically moving and instead using a controller, participants will be able to traverse freely with no physical limitations.

Arm Movements
* By using arm movements instead of leg movements, participants will be able to traverse freely without walking.
